streamlit==1.30.0
altair==5.0.1
pandas==2.2.0
# Use a NumPy 1.25.x wheel to avoid building from source on Streamlit Cloud
# (1.26.0 may require system BLAS/CMake/Fortran and fail to build in the cloud).
numpy==1.25.4
# Removed scipy==1.11.0 because Streamlit Community Cloud lacks Fortran/compiler for building SciPy from source.
# If you need SciPy, consider deploying via Docker or choosing a Python/runtime that has prebuilt wheels.
